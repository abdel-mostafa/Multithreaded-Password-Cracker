# Multithreaded-Password-Cracker
This project implements a multithreaded password cracker that demonstrates how multiple threads can work together to solve a computationally intensive problem faster than a single thread could alone. The program searches for a password by trying all possible combinations and checking if their hash matches a target hash.
